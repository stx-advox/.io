# AdvoxDAO Clan Representatives Issue

- **Issue Name:**
AdvoxDAO Clan Representatives Selection

- **Issue Description:** 
We will give time in a community session in the week of 9/19-9/23 for selection of six clan representatives. This selection will then be confirmed via our consensus flows in #active-issues and #formal-issues in following days. We need our reps first, this will ensure the issue consensus completes. 

- **Artifacts & References:**

1. We have 3 clans but need to select 6 representatives to ensure our autonomous decision making goals are met. 3 Female Reps 3 Male Reps. 

2. All clan reps will be temporary but must have basic understanding of our Turtle, Wolf and Bear [clan model](https://discord.com/channels/621759717756370964/916371047102705704/1012059812130992128). 

3. All Reps must be consistently available for monthly facilitation of active AdvoxDAO issues described below. Sub reps can be chosen by reps for support in facilitation & emergency absence. 

4. The Clan Reps have different simple actions to be taken in AdvoxDAO discord channels to ensure we smoothly complete our consensus decision making flows. 

5. Our latest SoP is [here](https://advox-dao.com/advoxgov/upcoming/active-issues/).

6. Clans reps are both selected & removed when needed with our consensus tools described above.
