# Quick Clan Design FAQ

**Why the Clan distinctions?**

- Autonomy of all generators of value are structurally accounted for in the Clan Design below, even ensuring voices of **Women & Ecosystems are not drowned out in long term.**


**How Does it Work?**

- We use governance tools from Harvard/Oxford born Metagov research group, see advoxDAO section in the main Stacks Discord.


**What research is behind this?**

- [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](https://generativejustice.org/) & [National Center of Scientific Research in Paris](https://cyber.harvard.edu/people/pdefilippi) Point to Explicit Autonomy in decision making for Women, regenerative ecosystems as critical in both the Native context & the potential of long term sustainability in OSS of Web3'

- We work alongside a Native Two Row Wampum Council for guidance in bottom up organization. 

- These structures gave rise to the modern concepts of representative democracy, decentralized autonomous confederation etc.
