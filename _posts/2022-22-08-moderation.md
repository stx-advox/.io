## Stacks Discord Server
General community moderation to answer inquiries people post questions about

Moderation should trend towards a full 24hr coverage

Duplicate this task and mention your moderation actions which include:

Reporting scams

Answering non support related questions

Providing guidance to new comers around the stacks ecosystem (stacks server channels, nft projects, wallets and so onâ€¦)

Quite often new comers land in either #general or #support channels in the stacks server there you will most of your moderation work

The KPI which would measure the impact would be in the shape of discord links to threads or messages, sometimes screenshots of the end of your conversation on how you helped out the community member.
