# Hello Advox Walk Through Coming Soon

The mission of the Advocates Program (Advox) is to distribute power. Ensuring voice for generators of value. Advox offers a welcoming space for anyone to get involved in the Stacks community. Supported by Stacksâ€™ unique stacking mechanism, members of Advox share in the value that we collectively create.
