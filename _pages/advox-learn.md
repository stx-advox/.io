# Did-a-thing Clan Reactions

![Did-a-Thing.png](https://github.com/stx-advox/land/blob/master/assets/images/Did-a-Thing.png)

- Go to the #start-here channel under the Advox DAO category in the official STX discord to get started
- **The didathing channel** will show you tons of diverse contributions as examples of the things you can contribute to the ecosystem
- The props channel is where other advocates express gratitude for another community member for something they did, garnering an environment of mutual appreciation.

- **Advox Clan Design** is fluid so we can identify whenever a certain contribution seems to speak to particular clan traits
- This is important tracking intrinsic motivavtions and leveraging this through out the Advox system design
- This along with number value weights help us with our P2P evaluations & review
- We've done an entire overhaul to the SourceCred alogorithm to achieve clear customizable weights

## Advox Clan System

### üê¢Commons Loop Closing

We can think of the Turtle clan as master architects & engineers that hold the blueprints ‚Ä¶but in this case the house is on a planetary scale. Key characteristics or functions of Turtles in a system are **_observation & validation_**.

  

Whether in formal decision making or informal organization, Turtles are the ones who observe deliberation between Wolf and Bear and validate whether protocols were followed. In an informal interaction, for example, the Turtle will be the quiet one during a dialogue, waiting until the end to weigh the dialogue against the core values of the system.

  

One step removed from direct facilitation of the other clans, and with a keen engineering eye, Turtles make for the ideal trackers of closed loops of values. So Turtles are tracking the dialogue and sense-making between clans to ensure integrity of the system, to ensure value is circulated to where generators of that value work and live, and to ensure that there is no pure extraction in the system design.

  

So this speaks to the sometimes abstract closed loops of governance protocols or community value circulation. It also includes the tangible closed loops needed in ecological sustainability the world over. Ensuring long term Commons sustainability of many variations is built right into our Stacks Advocates system. Turtles validate that these variations are aligned with core values.

  

### üê∫Commons Accessibility

Wolf clan can be thought of as initiators, the constantly moving facilitators of Commons accessibility. The sparks for deliberation of important issues or actions; the guides for empowered paths of information dissemination. Key function being **_to gather the minds and voices of generators of value in consensus_**.

  

In formal decision making protocols it is a Wolf clan representative who initiates processes; bringing issues to the floor. Deliberation, if at all needed, happens between Wolf & Bear clans while the Turtle clan observes before validation or further deliberation. Wolf clan‚Äôs informal social organization function revolves around providing direct access to Commons to anybody interested. Whether the Commons of empowered bottom up consensus decision making or the Commons of innovation and value(s) circulation in the Stacks Advocates ecosystem. This empowered accessibility functions as a regenerating catalyst to push ecosystems forward.

  

### üêªCommons Evolution

Bear clan is simple, just think of it as effective medicine. Then think of medicine in all its possible forms; even the function of good friendship or guidance. Bears are the masters of transformative potential and effective transition. Key for our Stacks ecosystem, focused on OSS in Can‚Äôt Be Evil design & engineering, for a user-empowered internet. Transformation away from conventional models is fundamental for folks coming into our ecosystem, but just as important for our system too.

  

The Bear clan‚Äôs key functions are **_ensuring the growth or evolution of complex systems are healthy_**. Bears are responsible for the bridgework away from harmful structures‚Ä¶ but they are also responsible for ensuring we don‚Äôt move too hastily into paradigm-shifting innovation. Bears are the medicine necessary for slowing down the process of change while doing due diligence to harvest and repurpose institutional leftovers on the careful terms of the community.

  

### The recursion of Turtle, Wolf, & Bear

Turtle is first in the ordered sequence, with all the elements of Wolf & Bear therein. Wolf & Bear are twins. Wolf coming before Bear in the sequence. This hints at a dynamic use of the three tiered system design rather than static. All three clans have a kind of  ‚Äúmemory‚Äù of one another, to be executed when needed in formal or informal social organization. Although one may be Turtle clan officially, in a given interaction, they may be best suited to assume their Wolf or Bear functions too.



## Background 
**Turtle, Wolf, & Bear Relationship, Governance, & Sustainability**

Important to our governance & bottom up organization efforts is our direct dialogue with a historical indigenous council, The Kanienke'ha'ka (Mohawk) of The Five Nations Longhouse Confederacy. Early settler colonists were exposed to their matrilineal protocols of organization, which catalyzed modern concepts and language of Democratic values, Federalism, three branches of government & much more.

We have rare access to these protocols in pre-colonial form. We realize there was an entire culture of checks & balances omitted from our modern systems of social organization & representation, precisely due to lack of peaceful dialogue with Native nations.

Turtle, Wolf & Bear are our first steps on a path to a decolonized dialogue that can enable authentic alternatives to conventional governance, which is often easier said than actually achieved. TWB is the three tiered clan system of the Kanienke'ha'ka, which for millennia carved empowered paths of bottom up representation for entire Native nations. Speaking to deep cosmological functions of organization, the protocols are designed to maximize modularity for any collective of autonomous organizations.

Even though not all of us are interested in governance, accessible structures designed for empowered voices & representation are fundamental to fair power distribution. With TWB tapping into deep functions of the STX ecosystem, we can leverage autonomous organization well beyond just governance benefits & into blockchain innovation sustainability. Bottom up power here includes built-in structures for innovation decoupled from top down, value alienating control.

As STX advocates, we recognize this as a historical chance to achieve distributed power in blockchain based systems. An important means for long term sustainability in blockchain systems. Hope you are as excited as we are to learn and build together in this indigenous dialogue for sustainable protocols of organization.

## Advox Clan Governance 
- Active Issues is where you‚Äôll find the clans coming into play, see different community governance proposals to learn why the advocates program is the way it is now.
- But also participate through your clan role, and have your voice heard at the heart of AdvoxDAO decision making processes
- Clan traits alos play a critical role is our consesnus tools shown below. Leveraging Harvard/Oxford Metagov research group's PolicyKit.

## Web3GovTools
- We managed to build PolicyKit interactions right into the discord for users, with the post author‚Äôs thread updates being uploaded to PK seamlessly.

- As a user I should be able to start an issue by posting in [#active-issues](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23active-issues)
- As a user I should be able to see a help text telling me what the process is gonna be like
- As a user I should be able to discuss and make edits to the original issue that being the message
- As a user I should be able to see the last revision of the issue in the [#formal-proposals](https://paper.dropbox.com/?q=%23formal-proposals) channel after the period of discussion expires
- As a user I should be able to dissent to the formal proposal during the voting period
- As a user I should be able to know who dissented on a resolution
- As a non contributor I should be able to dissent even tho my vote does not count
- As a user I should be able to join the governance process of a specific issue by reacting with üëÄ
- As a user I should be able to see if the proposal has passed or failed 

## Distributed Power Model
### Clan Design + Modular Consensus Tools
![clantools.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/clantools.jpg?raw=true)

### Clan Flow: #Active-issues

use of the #active-issues channel

**Preliminary Consensus**

0 | Picking up issues

Female & Male Wolf representatives or the Wolf sub-representatives pick up issues **deemed relevant** in broader Stacks ecosystem or AdvoxDAO. Particularly issues that are picking up steam in dialogue from multiple parties in the channels.

1 | Autonomous Clan Facilitation

First, Wolf clan reps tag other clans as needed to tend to the issue. All three clans use the #active-issues channels as needed to deliberate the issue, each using autonomous processes. The bottom up quorum period of participation will need to be decided for consensus; real-time meetings for time zones and schedules will need to be initiated where possible or thread dialogue when not possible.

2 | Autonomous Clan Prelims

Two representatives, one female and one male, from each of the 3 clans, come to consensus in autonomous processes before moving to formal consensus, where dialogue will converge. This is critical to sustainability. Through the long term, complex dynamics of our ecosystem, it is ensured that the autonomous voices of women & ecosystems are not drowned out.

![clanflow.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/clanflow.jpg?raw=true)

Throughout the Preliminary phase, there is communication between the 6 clan reps  (3 female and 3 male). This means the formal phase is virtually just a formalization of what has already been discussed in prelim phase consensus. A critical means for streamlining as many voices as possible while avoiding gridlock.

  

**We currently have no temporary representatives in place, so prelim phase facilitation leads will need to be determined by respective clans until we have selected our reps.**

This is a basic oversimplified use of the #activeissues channel tooling for respective clan consensus. The tooling is to be customized as need to suit the respective clan consensus flows.

### Formal Consensus

3 | Streamlining the Autonomous Processes in Formal Consensus

While 9 times out of 10 all positions brought to the floor have already been covered in prelims to easily be made official; this is the first time the female and males are sitting together in decision making. And deliberation is still possible in this formal phase in the rare case it is needed. And here we see a streamlining of autonomous processes, not just between female and male decision making but also between human systems & ecosystems. This is evident in the physical lay out & flow of the formal phase:

  

-   _Male Wolf Clan introduces the issues to the floor. If any needed deliberation, it happens between Bear & Wolf clans, while Turtles observe the deliberation and validate against core collective values, before passing through to be made official._

![clandeliberation.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/clandeliberation.jpg?raw=true)
  

Both Wolf clans, female and male, sit with their backs to the North. Both Bear clans sit with their backs to the South. But the Female Turtle clan sit with their backs to the West and the Male Turtles with their backs to the East. So while the other clans‚Äô deliberation can occur easily between female & male because they are sitting next to each other, for Turtles to come to consensus on positions there has to be movement across the council floor. And this is a critical mechanism for both social organization resilience & ecological sustainability.

### Formal Consensus: Preservation of Autonomy

Below is a description of how preservation of autonomy in social organization & ecosystems is represented by the Female Turtles walking over to the male Turtles to reach consensus on positions. And how even in this digital space this functions as a critical means to streamlining resilient social consensus in general:

![turtleflow.jpg](https://github.com/stx-advox/stacks-advocates/blob/main/assets/css/turtleflow.jpg?raw=true)

With the [traits of the clans](https://github.com/stx-advox/coc/blob/main/README.md#intro) in full function in decision making, the Turtle‚Äôs function here is a last nuance in a long flow of decision making protocols that decouples top down concentrated power, enabling autonomous innovation for generators of value, including our ecosystems.

**AdvoxDAO Soon to implement MicroDAOs**

As we roll out our first uses of our consensus flow tooling for decision making, Hozz has also been heads down the last couple weeks on the temporarily named 'Distacular bot' enabling on-chain transactions right inside discord for AdvoxDAO users. Short readable and open source Clarity contracts enabling users to send stx to on another with their .btc names. Also users can create on-chain funding proposals, create microDAOs, execute funding on DAOs etc. We are super excited for implementing this tooling in combination with our bottom up quorum tooling already in use. We believe this can give us a unique approach to Advox task creation but also our first steps at supporting accessibility to the Stacks Grants programs!
